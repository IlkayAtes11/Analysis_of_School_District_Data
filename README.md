# Analysis of School District Data

Aim of this analysis is to see the trends of standardized test scores among different schools in a specific district. This project will help the authorities to understand the reasons behind the successes/failures of different schools and act accordingly in the future. 

There are two data sets, which are 'schools data' and 'students data'. Before starting analysis, these two datasets were merged.
